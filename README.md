I'm new and have zero knowledge! Please help!
I'm new to the world of internet security and "ethical hacking  a very fat learner and have 31 years of vinalla computer experience. With that being aid said I've always been interested in every single thing to do with hacking internet security coding amount much more... 
I guess I'm basically asking some one with more knowledge and or experience to just be a street light for me as I walk all alone down this road that is HACKING

            Thanks,
